### Book : How To Influence People (Dale Carnegie)
1. Bury Your Boomerangs
Do not criticize, condemn or complain. If angry, avoid the initial outburst, calm down and then communicate.
Resist bad-mouthing as a differentiation strategy.
Remove your agenda from your messages to make them more effective.
“I am what’s wrong with the world”

2. Affirm What’s Good
Do not confuse it with flattery - difference is genuine concern.
Affirmation requires us to really see and understand the person, as opposed to flattery which conveys lack of interest.
Moments of being let down, disappointed, betrayed feel bad, but they also offer an opportunity to make a great impression - through forgiveness instead of outburst.
Competition to stand apart - only get a few moments.
Don’t ignore the conflicts or cover them up, instead address them head on but with grace and affirmations.

3. Connect with Core Desires
Influence requires more intuition than intellect.
Put yourself in the place of another.
Influence requires a gentle hand.
Messenger should discover what the recipient wants, instead of telling them what the recipient wants.
We can easily get info on people’s core desires via social media.

4. Take Interests in Others’ Interests 
Our longing for significance in the lives of others is complicated by our selfishness. We are interested primarily in ourselves, cannot be changed - self-preservation by default.
Be mindful of what we are self - defending against - ensure it is not self - detention.
People are attracted to people who care about what interests them - this is based on others being self - interested.
Influence is an outcropping of trust - the higher the trust, the more the influence. 
Incorporate others’ interests into your own, and then your interests would also be met in the process of helping others.
Aim for relationships instead of business -  get to know the person as opposed to hitting them with your agenda. Instead of scratching each other's back(bartering), aim for reciprocity.
Nowadays it is very easy to find out others' interests due to social media - spend a few minutes daily getting to know people - more empathy for someone going through a bad day, wish people on bdays, common acquaintances, fodder for future conversations.
Access leads to connections leads to relationships leads to affinity leads to influence leads to conversion.
Human relations are always easier when they begin from a place of affinity.
The potential for relational connectivity is astronomical.

5. Smile 
Important social asset.
Have a proliferation effect. - Happiness is not only a function of personal experiences, but is also a property of groups.
People who smile tend to have more friends. They tend to be more central to the network than those who do not smile.
When we smile, we let the recipient know that we are happy to be with them, see them, and interact with them.
However it is difficult to smile through digital communications. Digital communication is more misleading compared to traditional as the content can be read in different ways by the recipient.
Emoticons/emojis can solve this issue to an extent in casual conversations, but this cannot be used in professional communications.
How you write an email, the tone and words chosen are critical in professional communication since this is the only way to convey your emotion.
In situations that demand a more serious tone, while the content may be down, try to begin and end the message on a positive note, so that the linear thread of the message still stays upwards.
If you are unable to keep it positive, it could be an indication to wait a bit till you find one, or to not send the message at all. It could very well be a knee jerk response that wasn’t thought out that could have adverse effects in the future.
Written words and their effect are permanent and largely irrefutable. If it is not possible to be positive, avoid sending it or risk being slightly unprofessional using emoticons. 
Speaking digitally is more complex - facial expressions, tone, and the words you choose often express more than the words alone. Tone is very important here. 
Studies have shown that smiling on the phone even though the recipient does not see it, improves tone.
The internet is a medium to others, understand that there is a person on the other end. We cannot dismiss it simply because it is online. Remember that there are two sets of minds at work like every interaction.
Smiling increases your face value.

6. Reign with names
Names are important, and signify much more.
Remembering others’ names can lead to more influence - they will remember you(and your name), especially if you didn't need to remember their names => leading to influence
Napoleon III’s technique of remembering names - repeat the name several times in the conversation, associate it with the person’s features, expression and general appearance, write down the name on a paper, look and concentrate on it for a while to secure it in his mind then dispose of it(visually impression of the name instead of just audible).
Online promotes cursory reading, hurried and distracted thinking and superficial learning - difficult to remember things now. So it is even advantageous important to stand out
Instead of just hey, append their name to it. Visualize the person’s face and their characteristics, and any details you know about them. If possible, try to remember their interests.
Use people’s names in the right context, be careful with informal versions of their names
People are more interested in their names than others, hence when we remember and use them correctly, it is a subtle and very effective compliment. But if you forget/misspell it, you place yourself at a sharp disadvantage.
 
7. Listen Longer
People desire to be heard and understood.
A daily presence can ensure that you are connected to people on a lasting level.
In interviews, ask questions as they like to be listened to too.
To ensure daily presence, ask 15 questions per day : 1st five to friends and family, next 5 to work, last 5 to online friends
