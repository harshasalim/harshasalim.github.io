  aboutme:
    "I am currently working as a Developer Consultant in Thoughtworks where I mostly develop applications. I enjoy learning new topics within Computer Science, and love experimenting using personal projects. I have explored various topics in the past few years, including Blockchain, Distributed Systems, Security and Cloud Computing. I also have started writing technical blogs to document my learnings. I enjoy contributing to the women dev communities as much as I love learning from it, and am active member of many. In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, dancing, listening to various podcasts and watching anime. I used to get quite anxious interacting with new people, but I am getting mcuh better at it. Last, but not the least, I love cats <3",
